                    NSDC was set up as part of a national skill development mission to
                    fulfil the growing need in India for skilled manpower across sectors
                    and narrow the existing gap between the demand and supply of skills.
                    “There is a compelling need to launch a world-class skill development
                    programme in a mission mode that will address the challenge of
                    imparting the skills required by a growing economy. Both the structure
